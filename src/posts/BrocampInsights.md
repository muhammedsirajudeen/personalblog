# Brocamp Insights

The primary driver for me clearing all of the reviews in Brototype was that I was a **hobbyist at heart**. Being a hobbyist, Brocamp felt like a **gamified experience** for me—it was more like playing video games rather than completing boring tasks.  

Most of the things I followed would normally require immense discipline for someone else to replicate. But for me, it clicked naturally.

## My Routine & Mindset
- In the initial days, I never sat past **5 or 6 p.m.**  
- I could only crank out about **4–5 hours of true productivity** each day.  
- The rest of the time was spent:
  - Messing around  
  - Eating biriyani  
  - Visiting Calicut cafeteria for mandhi  
  - Sleeping on Sundays  

But when I did work, I **cut out all distractions** and ensured that my work created **impact**.  

👉 I wasn’t sitting there just to “look” productive.  
👉 I measured **impact, not hours**.  

If I could get the same impact in 3 hours, I would rather do that and sleep the rest of the day.

## Factors That Helped Me
- **Luck & relativeness**: I had been into technology since childhood.  
- By the time I joined Brocamp, I had **over 5 years of programming experience**.  
- Reviewers quickly realized that I wasn’t new to coding—I had already been doing it for a long time.

## Key Insights

### 1. Deep Reading Matters
- I spent most of my time reading **technical documentation**.  
- Sometimes I went for deep dives—like how Node.js actually handles file I/O internally.  
- But for most people, that level of depth isn’t necessary.  
- Usually, having an **overview** is enough, even for reviews.  

📌 Truth: Most reviewers themselves won’t go extremely deep into Node.js internals (that takes months of source-code study).

### 2. Core Computer Science Concepts
Having a good grasp on **computer science fundamentals** will give you an edge:
- Networking (TCP/IP)  
- Threading & concurrency  
- Operating system basics  

👉 Recommended resource: [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

### 3. Documentation Is Your Best Friend
If you’re learning the **MERN Stack**, official docs are gold:  
- [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)  
- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn)  
- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/)  
- [Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)  

I personally read through these **over and over again**, especially:
- Before domain weeks  
- Before critical interviews

### 4. Communication > Technical Skills
Your ability to **communicate and convince people** matters more than just technical skill.  
- Even with average coding knowledge, good communication can help you pass reviews.  
- But if you combine **strong technical skills + strong communication**, you will pass with flying colors.  

---

### 5. The Takeoff Interview
One request to everyone: **complete your takeoff interview**, even if you already get offers.  

Why?  
- Placements teach you the **art of selling yourself**.  
- You learn how to **present your skills effectively**.  
- For aspiring entrepreneurs, this is your **salesman training period**.  

Think of it as the phase where you’re **building the skill of selling**—something priceless in today’s world.

## Final Note
Without prior technical knowledge, it may be hard to clear all reviews on the first attempt.  
But with **grit, perseverance, and the right mix of technical + communication skills**, it is absolutely possible.  

🔥 Brocamp is not just about coding—it’s about learning how to deliver **impact** and how to **sell your skills**.
