# TACKLING LEETCODE

As you might have guessed Iam not a big fan of leetcode style problems but Iam deeply interested in data structures and algorithms. I know that statements are contradicting but they are really not. It has been very easy for me to build software it's essentially how I think so software development and building applications came naturally to me. The first applciation that i ever built was a GUI using Tkinter a medicine management application built using Tkinter with sql integrations and I tried to implement live chat in it but my knowledge wasn't sufficient at that time and I was 16 at the time. Since then I have been building software for one thing or the another. So you can say that I'm a hobbyist software engineer this is what I pursue as my hobby. It was very Intuitive to me I was able to comeup with solutions on my own. I would actually watch a tutorial If there was no means available to me otherwise I wont. My first Ecommerce application was built on my own. The process of building software breaking down complex problems into simple ones. Debugging errors finding root causes were always natural to me. So I pursued it as such(To be continued)
